Revision history for HTML-CruftText

0.04    2014-01-19
        * Instead of removing <!-- contents of HTML comments --> altogether,
          make multiline comments single-line and replace "[<>]" characters
          with "|".
        * Rename regexp callback subroutines to better explain what they're
          doing.
        * Remove precompiled regular expressions (didn't add any speed and
          weren't that reusable).

0.03    2014-01-19
        * Fixed handling of the last newline in the HTML page.
        * Fixed a way to count lines.
        * Improved formatting of debugging messages.
        * Added RDF comment unit test.

0.02    2014-01-18
        * Replaced state machine-based implementation with a (faster) "regexp +
          callback subroutine"-based implementation while also maintaining
          backwards compatibility (both API and bugs are replicated too).
        * Covered each of the internal subroutines ("helpers") with their very
          own unit test so that one can now test those subroutines
          independently.
        * Covered successive newline removal behavior with unit tests.
        * Fixed POD description regarding removal of HTML comments.
        * Renamed some internal subroutines ("helpers") in order for their
          names to better reflect what those subroutines are actually doing.
        * Moved a list of ignored files to ".gitignore".
